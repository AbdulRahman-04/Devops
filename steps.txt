// Setup for Devops

1. Make sure you have a cloud service like : GCP, Azure, AWS and Digital Ocean.

2.Make sure your project/app is working fine in locally.

3. Purchase a domain and cloud service.

4. Domains can purchased from
 - NameCheap
 - Big Rock
 - Hostinger
 - Go Daddy


 5. Cloud Service Instance:

 - AWS
 - Azure
 - GCP
 - Digital Ocean

6. Local App Setup: 

1. HTML And Backend App SETUP: 

 - make sure you have build folder and index.html file init
 - in the same folder you should have simple express server, with these code lines
 - Add the path and url lines in express (copy the below code for app.js)
 
 
 ...

 import express from "express";
 import path from "path";
 import {fileURLToPath} from "url";

 const --filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
 const --dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

 import routes here

 db connect here

 const app = express();
 const PORT = 5005;

 app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "build")));

 app.get("/rahman", (req, res)=>{
    try{
        res.status(200).json({msg: "hello sneha"})
    } catch(error){
        res.status(401).json(error)
    }
 });


 write all routes from controllers, middleware, public api's in between here

 // new 3 lines 

 app.get("/*", (req, res)=>{
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "build", "index.html"));
 });

...


2. React vite with backend setup:

1. Make sure hello world in react is working (tailwind css is optional or bootstrap).

2. cd client
3. npm run build 
4. this will generate a dist folder 
which is a optimised folder for your whole react app
(delete the build folder from server)

5. mv ../server
6. cd server
7. open app.js and change all build folder to dist
8. npm start
